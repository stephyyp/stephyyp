# Poetry Interpretation Page

Welcome to your Poetry Interpretation project! This project will teach you professional web development workflows using GitHub Issues as specifications.

## Project Overview

You'll create a beautiful webpage displaying a poem of your choice, using modern web development tools and practices. This project uses GitHub Issues to track requirements - each issue represents a specification you must complete.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Initialize Your Specifications

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in your repository
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select "Initialize Specifications" template
4. Submit the issue (don't change the title!)
5. GitHub Actions will automatically create 4 specification issues for you
6. The original issue will close automatically

### Step 2: Complete Each Specification

You'll have 4 specifications to complete:

1. **Professional Tooling Setup** - Set up npm and Prettier (see `docs/prettier-guide.md` for what Prettier does)
2. **Semantic HTML Structure** - Create accessible, semantic HTML
3. **CSS Typography & Layout** - Design a beautiful, responsive layout
4. **Documentation & Deployment** - Document your work and deploy to Netlify

### Step 3: Track Your Progress

- Each specification starts with the label `status:todo`
- When you complete ALL requirements in a specification, change the label to `status:ready-for-review`
- Check every box in every issue - this is pass/fail with no partial credit

## Project Requirements

### Choosing Your Poem

Use the Poem from the Poetry Planning assignment

### Documentation Structure

Your project should follow this structure:

```

â”œâ”€â”€ index.html                          # Your poem page
â”œâ”€â”€ css/                                # Styles folder

    â”œâ”€â”€ prettier-guide.md               # What Prettier does and why it helps
    â””â”€â”€ evidence/                       # Only 2 screenshots required:
        â”œâ”€â”€ w3c-validation.png

## Using GitHub Copilot

You're encouraged to use GitHub Copilot's three modes to help you learn and build:

- **Ask Mode** - For understanding concepts and planning (uses fewer tokens)
- **Agent Mode** - For building features and generating code (uses more tokens)
- **Edit Mode** - For modifying existing code across files

ðŸ“š **Need help with prompts?** Check out `docs/copilot-prompts.md` for specific prompts and examples for each specification!

Document your experience in `copilot-collaboration.md` using the template provided in `docs/copilot-collaboration-template.md`. Keep it simple - just 3-5 key interactions showing which mode you used and what you learned.

Reference your files using `#file:` syntax (e.g., `#file:project-goals.md`) to give Copilot context about your specific project.

## Deployment Instructions

### Setting Up Netlify

1. Create a free account at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Deploy your site
4. Customize your site name (no random strings!)
5. Add the live URL to this README

### Your Live Site

**Netlify URL:** [Add your URL here after deployment]

## Technologies Used

[Update this section as you work]

- HTML5
- CSS3
- npm
- Prettier (see `docs/prettier-guide.md` for details)
- GitHub Copilot (Ask, Agent, and Edit modes)

## Design Decisions

- [ ] Check every box in every specification
- [ ] Provide exactly 2 screenshots in docs/evidence/
- [ ] Deploy successfully to Netlify with a custom name
- [ ] Complete copilot-collaboration.md using the template (3-5 interactions)

### Evidence Requirements

Your repository and live site are your primary evidence. Only 2 screenshots required in `docs/evidence/`:

1. **w3c-validation.png** - W3C validator showing 0 errors (Spec 2)
2. **netlify-live.png** - Your deployed site (Spec 4)

## Need Help?
