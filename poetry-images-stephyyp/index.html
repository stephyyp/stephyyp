      <h2>Hope is the Thing With Feathers</h2>
      <p>“Hope” is the thing with feathers -<br>
         That perches in the soul -<br>
         And sings the tune without the words -<br>
         And never stops - at all -</p>
      
      <p>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br>
         And sore must be the storm -<br>
         That could abash the little Bird<br>
         That kept so many warm -</p>
  
      <p>I've heard it in the chillest land -<br>
         And on the strangest Sea -<br>
         Yet - never - in Extremity,<br>
         It asked a crumb - of me.</p>
